# Fall_Guys_AFK

A set of scripts (python and autohotkey) to automate the joining of Fall Guys games, including leaving the show when knocked out after the first round.

NOTE: These scripts do not perform any in-game actions, apart from occasionally jumping, and so will not help you cheat to win any shows. In opther words this is not a bot in any meaningful sense, and is not set up to allow users to cheat.
