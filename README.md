# Fall_Guys_AFK

A python script (and associated image files) to automate the joining of Fall Guys games, including leaving the show when knocked out after the first round.

NOTE: These scripts do not perform any in-game actions so this is not a bot in any meaningful sense, and will not help you cheat to win any shows.

Requirements:

Windows

(configured to run in the smallest resolution, 720x400)
