# Fall_Guys_AFK

A python script (and associated image files) to automate the joining of Fall Guys games, including leaving the show when knocked out after the first round.

NOTE: These scripts do not perform any in-game actions so this is not a bot in any meaningful sense, and will not help you cheat to win any shows.

Requirements:

Windows

Fall Guys:    https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/
(configured to run in the smallest resolution, 720x400)

python:       https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

the script: fall_guys_afk.py

You can also get the following, but the script will obtain them if you dont):

imagesearch:  https://brokencode.io/how-to-easily-image-search-with-python/

all the files keeping the same directory structure:  https://github.com/culcube/Fall_Guys_AFK

run it in a terminal:
  python ./fall_guys_afk.py
